Code Questions
- Shiny App: Do the server and the ui need the same code? (there seems to be a doubling of code)


Extensions possible
- data & Shiny: add other energy sources
DONE-- 1st step: add wind
-- later: add the others
-- How to deal with off-shore wind that is not located at the map?
--- maybe use the geo information from the source and put little dots on the map for the location?
DONE-- How can we choose different colors in Shiny depending on the source of energy?

- Shiny: year by year resolution in additional gif below
-- prepare data with simple year column
-- show state variable of existing facilities for the end of a specific year

- Shiny: numeric sidebar for the number of categories (2-15)
