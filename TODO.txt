********** Extensions possible ***********
******************************************

******************************************
***** 1)
2-4 hours
- data & Shiny: add other energy sources
DONE-- 1st step: add wind
-- later: add the others
-- use different colors in Shiny
--- biomass: should be green (change color of solar to yellow)
--- coal: grey-black
--- brown coal: bright brown - dark brown
--- nuclear: green - neon-green (from a normal green to a very bright and shining green?)
--- etc. ...
DONE-- How can we choose different colors in Shiny depending on the source of energy?



******************************************
***** 2)
1-2 hours
- Shiny: numeric sidebar for the number of categories in the legend and graphic (2-15, start: 10)
-- sliderInput
https://shiny.rstudio.com/reference/shiny/0.14/sliderInput.html
(other panels: conditionalPanel, etc.?)


******************************************
***** 3)
1-2 hour
- Shiny: add average power plant production potential as output variable
-- already calculated and in the processed data
-- just needs a Shiny integration


******************************************
***** 4)
3-6 hours
- Shiny: evolvement of production potential over time
-- Data: prepare data with simple year column
--- show state variable of existing facilities for the end of a specific year
-- Shiny: additional gif or multiple plots in different years (below the current graphic)


******************************************
***** 5)
4-8 hours
- Shiny: Show exact location of power plants
-- in second map below or maybe in the same grahpic?
(below might be problematic since the place is already used by 
-- Data: There is information on the geographical location (degree of latitude and longitude) of (some) power plants an the source data
-- Data: make the geographic information campatible with the shape file and print it
-- Shiny: export plot to Shiny
-- Shiny: use a "Yes/No" choice of the user to show the dots in the first map?


******************************************
***** 6)
2-4 hours
- How to deal with offshore wind that is not located at the map?
-- can rely on the work before
-- maybe use the geo information from the source and put little dots on the map for the location?
- How to express the output variables for these?


******************************************
***** 7)
2-4 hours
- Shiny Dashboard?
-- another style for showing the ui
-- dashboardPage
--- dashboardHeader, DashboardSidebar, menu(Sub)Item, sliderInput, ...
--- dashboardBody: fluidRow, box, plotOutput, sliderInput, ...
-- server.R can be the same
